TypTop: Personalized Typo-tolerant Password Checker
----------------------------------------------------------------

Hello!

Typtop observes for password typing mistakes, and enable logging
in with slight variations of your actual login password that are
frequent and safe. This software attaches a new pluggable
authentication module (PAM) to all of your common authentication
processes, such as su, login, lock-screen etc.


Thanks for installing TypToP.  This is a research prototype, and
we are collecting some anonymous non-sensitive data about your
password typing patterns to verify our design. The details of
what data we collect, how we collect and store, and the security
blueprint of this software can be found in the website
https://typtop.info.

The participation in the study is completely voluntary, and you
can opt out at any time while still keep using the software.

Checkout the utilit script `typtop` for configuration options
(such as how to opt out of the study) by typing 'typtop' in the
terminal.
